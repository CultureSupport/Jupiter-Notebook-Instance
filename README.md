for Dathu Code Language with Python

```
I will generate a Python script designed to run in a Jupyter environment. This script acts as a "Batch Job" generator that creates the **Dathu** language specification—a logical programming structure inspired by Sanskrit roots (*Dhatus*)—and generates a comprehensive set of functions and a cross-platform mobile app directory structure.

The generated output will include:

1. **Dathu Core Parser**: A Python-based interpreter logic to understand Dathu syntax.
2. **20 MB Synthetic Codebase**: A batch-generated file containing thousands of Dathu "Kriya" (functions) for mobile logic.
3. **Mobile Structure**: A dual-platform project layout designed to be interpreted by both Android (Kotlin-ready) and iOS (Swift-ready) bridges.

### Summary of Generation

* **Batch Job Script**: Created `dathu_batch_job.py`, which automates the creation of the 20MB file and folder hierarchy.
* **Language Logic**: Defined a "Side-Crossing" environment in `dharana.py` to handle the transition between Dathu scripts and native mobile platforms.
* **Dathu Functions**: Generated a massive library of functions (Kriyas) based on Sanskrit roots to simulate a production-scale mobile logic layer.

### How to use:

1. Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook cell.
2. It will create a folder named `dathu_mobile_project`.
3. Inside, you will find the 20MB `.dathu` file containing the generated functions.
4. The `core` directory provides the bridge for Android/iOS cross-platform execution.




## Use Dathu in Side Way of iOS apps and Android

We can turn Apps into Brigde With Dathu and Parallel Drive Instanses and Side Crossing android and iOS

Use Dathu as Engine to Run Large iOS And Android. It Wil Also Be Option To Generate as Virtual Parser and Run Large Pre Coded Dathu Code Projects, and Execute Apps into Software Kernels
